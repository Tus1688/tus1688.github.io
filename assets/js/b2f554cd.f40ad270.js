My old computer became extremely slow and unresponsive while I was learning basic react. I take advantage of those opportunities to force myself to migrate to Linux. Although Linux has better ram and CPU usage, at some point during my learning, those **heavy** gnome + Ubuntu become unresponsive, and guess what? I use vim and have become addicted to it. Since then, I can\'t get enough of vim and have an insatiable desire to learn new things.\\n\\n:::info\\nuse `:q` to quit vim\\n:::\\n\\n## What I\'m currently learning?\\n\\nI focused on information security, so having a great grasp of all languages would be ideal, including assembly. However, since I\'m not a gigachad, I chose golang, typescript, python, and a healthy dosage of c#, c++, and ruby instead.\\n\\n## What I\'m currently working on?\\n\\nInformation Security related tools and of course, university projects. I\'m also working on a project that I can\'t talk about yet, but I\'ll be sure to share it with you guys when it\'s ready. So stay tuned!"}]}')}}]);
