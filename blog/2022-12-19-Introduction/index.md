## Hi everyone

Welcome to my blog, TLDR; According to Dr. Chapman, there are five love languages: Words of Affirmation, Acts of Service, Receiving Gifts, Quality Time, and Physical Touch
and... **Python** is my love language.

## How I got into coding?

I discover that "solving" a question or creating new things gives me a sense of accomplishment as a mini wanna be entrepreneur. My old computer became extremely slow and unresponsive while I was learning basic react. I take advantage of those opportunities to force myself to migrate to Linux. Although Linux has better ram and CPU usage, at some point during my learning, those **heavy** gnome + Ubuntu become unresponsive, and guess what? I use vim and have become addicted to it. Since then, I can't get enough of vim and have an insatiable desire to learn new things.

## What I'm currently learning?

I focused on information security, so having a great grasp of all languages would be ideal, including assembly. However, since I'm not a gigachad, I chose golang, typescript, python, and a healthy dosage of c#, c++, and ruby instead.

## What I'm currently working on?

Information Security related tools and of course, university projects. I'm also working on a project that I can't talk about yet, but I'll be sure to share it with you guys when it's ready. So stay tuned!
