and... <strong>Python</strong> is my love language.</p><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-caution alert alert--warning admonition_LlT9"><div class="admonitionHeading_tbUL"><span class="admonitionIcon_kALy"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M8.893 1.5c-.183-.31-.52-.5-.887-.5s-.703.19-.886.5L.138 13.499a.98.98 0 0 0 0 1.001c.193.31.53.501.886.501h13.964c.367 0 .704-.19.877-.5a1.03 1.03 0 0 0 .01-1.002L8.893 1.5zm.133 11.497H6.987v-2.003h2.039v2.003zm0-3.004H6.987V5.987h2.039v4.006z"></path></svg></span>caution</div><div class="admonitionContent_S0QG"><p>This blog is still under construction, so please bear with me.</p></div></div><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-i-got-into-coding">How I got into coding?<a href="#how-i-got-into-coding" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How I got into coding?" title="Direct link to How I got into coding?">​</a></h2><p>I discover that "solving" a question or creating new things gives me a sense of accomplishment as a mini wanna be entrepreneur. My old computer became extremely slow and unresponsive while I was learning basic react. I take advantage of those opportunities to force myself to migrate to Linux. Although Linux has better ram and CPU usage, at some point during my learning, those <strong>heavy</strong> gnome + Ubuntu become unresponsive, and guess what? I use vim and have become addicted to it. Since then, I can't get enough of vim and have an insatiable desire to learn new things.</p><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-info alert alert--info admonition_LlT9"><div class="admonitionHeading_tbUL"><span class="admonitionIcon_kALy"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M7 2.3c3.14 0 5.7 2.56 5.7 5.7s-2.56 5.7-5.7 5.7A5.71 5.71 0 0 1 1.3 8c0-3.14 2.56-5.7 5.7-5.7zM7 1C3.14 1 0 4.14 0 8s3.14 7 7 7 7-3.14 7-7-3.14-7-7-7zm1 3H6v5h2V4zm0 6H6v2h2v-2z"></path></svg></span>info</div><div class="admonitionContent_S0QG"><p>use <code>:q</code> to quit vim</p></div></div><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-im-currently-learning">What I'm currently learning?<a href="#what-im-currently-learning" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What I'm currently learning?" title="Direct link to What I'm currently learning?">​</a></h2><p>I focused on information security, so having a great grasp of all languages would be ideal, including assembly. However, since I'm not a gigachad, I chose golang, typescript, python, and a healthy dosage of c#, c++, and ruby instead.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-im-currently-working-on">What I'm currently working on?<a href="#what-im-currently-working-on" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What I'm currently working on?" title="Direct link to What I'm currently working on?">​</a></h2><p>Information Security related tools and of course, university projects. I'm also working on a project that I can't talk about yet, but I'll be sure to share it with you guys when it's ready. So stay tuned!</p>]]></content>
