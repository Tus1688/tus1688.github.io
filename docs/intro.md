# Introduction

So in order to keep track of my progress in learning about Information Security
and Software Development, I stumbled upon the idea of documenting it as a blog. I have been trying
to learn about Information Security for a while now, but I have never really
"contributed" to the community in writing about it. I have been reading a lot of
blogs and articles, but I have never really written anything myself.

This is a work in progress, so I will be updating this page as I go along.

thanks for reading!
